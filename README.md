For Easy-Modeller :
First please make sure that :

1. You have downloaded the correct & latest version of MODELLER and installed the same in your PC ( Please follow the installation guides )
2. You have entered the correct license key for MODELLER ( obtained free after registering) 
3. You have downloaded and installed a compatible Python version ( preferably 2.6 or 2.7 but not >=3)

It would be best that if you first test whether MODELLER is working correctly in your system. To do this follow the steps below :

1. Go to command prompt (or terminal) and type : python

This should open the python IDLE and you should see a message like this :

Python 2.7.1+ (r271:86832, Apr 11 2011, 18:05:24) 
[GCC 4.5.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>  

N.B : If you have installed Python and still do not see this then make sure that you have set your path for Python correctly (although this should be done automatically)

2. Now inside  the Python IDLE type : import modeller

Python 2.7.1+ (r271:86832, Apr 11 2011, 18:05:24) 
[GCC 4.5.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import modeller
>>> 

If the module 'modeller' loads without giving and error message then you have successfully installed modeller and you should be able to run EasyModeller without any errors.


If you are still getting an error then please post it at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/easymodeller-discussion-forum with a details of the error message that appears in the terminal (or command prompt). 

Please add the following to your question :

1. Which Python version are you using ?
2. Which OS (Linux or Windows) are you using and what version ?
3. What is the architecture of your system (32 bit or 64 bit) ?
